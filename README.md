# NEXORA
NEXORA is a high-performance, terminal-based productivity suite written in C.
It combines Task Management, Note-taking, and an Automated Reminder system into one lightweight application.
It features multi-user support, smart search algorithms, and background processing.

 Key Features<br>

    👤 Multi-User System: Secure login/registration with independent data isolation for every user.<br>

    📋 Task Board: Create, delete, and track tasks with real-time Progress Bars.<br>

    📓 Smart Notes: A folder-based note system that saves your thoughts into organized .txt files.<br>

    🔍 Smart Search: Uses the Levenshtein Distance Algorithm to find tasks/notes even if you make a typo.<br>

    ⏰ Background Alarms: Set reminders or alarms using Multithreading. The program alerts you while you continue working.<br>

    🔊 System Integration:<br>

        Linux: Native notify-send pop-ups and espeak-ng voice alerts.<br>
        <br><br>
        Technical Highlights<br>

    Multithreading (Pthreads): Used to handle background alarms without freezing the main UI.<br>

    Dynamic File Naming: Automatically generates user-specific binary data and directory structures at runtime.<br>

    Fuzzy Logic: Implements string matching algorithms for an "approximate" search experience.<br>

    Thread Safety: Implements Mutex Locks to prevent data corruption during concurrent operations<br>

How to Use<br>

   1. Register: Create a new account on your first run.<br>
   2.Dashboard: View your progress bar and navigate through tasks or notes.<br>
   3.Smart Search: Use option [6] or [12] to search using approximate names.<br>
   4.Set Alarm: Enter a task ID and time (e.g., 05:30 PM). A background thread will trigger a notification and speak to you when the time comes!<br>
